Please note, this was called RESTBroker, but moved to Lapis as it away slightly from REST design principles.




RESTBroker is a application and user interface used to build, automate and self document REST APIs. It offers a wide variety of functional features which can be found on the [RESTBroker Website.](https://restbroker.com)
